I'm a software engineer based in Boston, Massachussetts. At work I design and build 
cloud-based data processing workflows, and my goal is to become a master of cloud architecture, code, and data alike, and to use that
expertise to solve big problems. 

Outside of work I'm an avid runner and cyclist and an aspiring triathlete. I'm also a recreational mathematician with a
mind for interesting side projects, like the ones you'll find on [this page](https://andrewcoggins.github.io/)!

I've been working at [Breakaway Partners](https://www.breakawaypartners.com/) since 2018. Before that, 
I studied Computer Science and Economics at Brown Univeristy.
